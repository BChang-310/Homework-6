# PGE310 Fall 2021 Homework 4

This homework is divided into 5 problems: 

  - Problem 1 is designed to help you practice logic flow with if, elif, and else statments.
  - Problem 2 will help you practice for loops with a fun code deciphering challenge.
  - Problem 3 covers a common type of problem in science and engineering called a parameter sweep. This can be done nicely with a for loop!
  - Problem 4 will give you practice with while loops in the context of a problem with prime numbers
  - Problem 5 will cover how to use for loops to code different types of summation and product formulas.


### New for this homework:
**Please submit this assignment as a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) on Github classroom.** 
Don't forget that you can still develop your code in Spyder. If you do use Spyder, copy and paste the required parts of your finished code from Spyder into the correct cells of the Jupyter Notebook template. We want you to practice submitting your code in a presentable format! 

Logic flow and loops are where many interesting programming challenges can be solved and automated!
